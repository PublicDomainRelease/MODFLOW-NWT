                           MODFLOW-NWT Release Notes


This file describes changes introduced into MODFLOW-NWT with each official
release; these changes may substantially affect users.

o Version 1.0 05/11/2011:

This version is the initial release. However, a number of changes were required  
for four additional MODFLOW-2005 Packages that were not explained in the 
MODFLOW-NWT documentation report (Niswonger and others, 2011). The modified 
packages include the Horizontal-Flow Barrier, Lake, and Multi-Node Well Packages
versions 1 and 2.

Changes to the Horizontal-Flow (HFB) Barrier Package were made to the subroutine
GWF2HFB7FM. If the Newton method is used in MODFLOW-NWT, then horizontal
conductances do not include the aquifer thickness for unconfined conditions.
Thus, equations were changed such that the conductances modified in subroutine
GWF2HFB7FM are not multiplied by the aquifer thickness. This change required that
a new argument be added to the call statement for subroutine GWF2HFB7FM to include
the file unit number for the UPW Package.

Changes to the Lake (LAK) Package were made to the subroutine GWF2LAK7RP and a new 
subroutine was added to the LAK Package called SGWF2LAK7UPW1RPS for calculating
lakebed conductance values. This change required that a new argument be added to
the call statement for subroutine GWF2LAK7RP to include the file unit number for
the UPW Package.

Changes to Versions 1 and 2 of the multi-Node Well (MNW1 and MNW2) Packages were
made to the subroutines GWF2MNW17RP and GWF2MNW27RP. A new subroutine was added to
the MNW1 and MNW2 Packages called CEL2WELUPW for calculating well conductance
values. A new argument was added to the call statement for subroutines GWF2MNW17RP
and GWF2MNW27RP to include the file unit number for the UPW Package.

o Version 1.0.1 05/27/2011:

Changes were made to the MODFLOW-NWT source files to correct an error in how the
Horizontal-Flow (HFB) Barrier Package was implemented in MODFLOW-NWT. Additionally,
changes were made to deallocate arrays in the XMD and GMRES solvers at the termination 
of a simulation.

Source files that were modified include: MF_NWT.f, NWT1_solver.f, NWT1_xmd.f,     
gwf2hfb7_NWT.f, NWT1_gmres.f90, and gwf2bas7.f
