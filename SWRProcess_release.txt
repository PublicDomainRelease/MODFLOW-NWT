This file describes changes introduced into the SWR Process with each 
official release; these changes may substantially affect users.

o Version 1.0 09/10/2012:

This version is the initial release.

o Version 1.01.0 10/17/2012:

The SWR Process was modified to allow incorporation of SWR derivative terms 
into the groundwater flow equation solved by MODFLOW-NWT. The SWR Process 
was also modified to allow downstream discharge from a SFR2 reach to be routed 
to a SWR reach using an additional SWR surface-water control structure. The 
SWR Process was also modified to allow surface-water control structures 
discharging from the SWR1 network to discharge to SFR2 reaches.

Modified input instructions for the SWR1 input file

Items 0-1a: As in previous versions of the code.

1b.  CSWROPT [IOPTUNIT]

USE_IMPLICIT_NEWTON_CORRECTION keyword for implicitly calculating the
  Newton correction term for the groundwater flow equation. This option
  requires solving SWR1 equations using the current and perturbed heads.
  As a result, SWR1 Process runtimes will be approximately a factor of 2
  greater.

USE_EXPLICIT_NEWTON_CORRECTION keyword for explicitly calculating the
  Newton correction term for the groundwater flow equation. This option
  calculated the Newton correction terms using the current SWR1 stage
  solution and current and perturbed heads within the aquifer-reach 
  exchange calculation routine (SSWR_CALC_QAQ). This option does not have 
  a significant effect on SWR1 Process runtimes and is sufficient for the 
  test problems evaluated.

By default, Newton corrections are not calculated. Only one of the keywords
  specified above should be used if Newton correction terms for the SWR1
  Process are desired.

Items 2-4c: As in previous versions of the code.

4d.  ITAB CTABTYPE CINTP [CTABRCH] [ITABRCH(1)...ITABRCH(NTABRCH)]
     
ITAB     - Number of tabular data item. ITAB value is the tabular data item
           that will be referred to by CSTRCRIT and CSTRVAL in Item 13b. 
           Tabular data items specified in Item 4d do not need to be specified 
           in numerical order.

ISTRRCH  - No changes
ISTRNUM  - Must be 0 if: (1) ISTRTYPE=11; or (2) SFR is specified in the MODFLOW-NWT name
           file and ISFRSEG and ISFRRCH > 0. No changes otherwise.
ISTRTYPE - ISTRTYPE=11 for a inflow structure from SFR2 segment ISFRSEG and reach ISFRRCH. 
           ISTRCONN must be 0 if ISTRTYPE=11. All other surface-water control structures
           detailed in the documentation report are available.

ISFRSEG  - SFR2 segment that (1) supplies downstream segment discharge to SWR1 reach 
           ISTRRCH or (2) SFR2 segment that receives SWR2 surface-water control 
           structure discharge. ISFRSEG is not read if SFR is not specified in the 
           MODFLOW-NWT name file.
ISFRRCH  - SFR2 reach in SFR2 segment ISFRSEG that receives SWR2 surface-water control  
           structure discharge. Any SFR2 reach number can be specified if ISTRTYPE=11.
           ISFRRCH is not read if SFR is not specified in the MODFLOW-NWT name file.

Items 13b-15: As in previous versions of the code.

o Version 1.02.0 01/17/2013:

The SWR Process was modified to allow RTMIN and RTMAX to set equal to the MODFLOW
DELT calculated for each time step in a stress period. Minor bug fix in the
SSWR_P_QMFLOW subroutine to output calculated reach connection flow and discharge
data to the correct location in the ascii and binary output file.

Modified input instructions for the SWR1 input file

Items 0-1b: As in previous versions of the code.

Item 2: DLENCONV TIMECONV RTINI RTMIN RTMAX RTPRN RTMULT NTMULT DMINGRAD DMNDEPTH 
        [DMAXRAI] [DMAXSTG] [DMAXINF]

DLENCONV - No changes
TIMECONV - No changes
RTINI    - No changes
RTMIN    - a real value that defines the minimum SWR1 time-step length to use. 
           RTMIN should be >= 0.0. If RTMIN = 0.0, RTMIN is set to the minimum 
           DELT for the current MODFLOW stress period. When RTMIN > 0.0, typical 
           values of RTMIN are between 1 and 30 seconds but is dependent on the 
           magnitude of streamflow. Value is in units of time and must be 
           consistent with the defined MODFLOW time unit.
RTMAX    - a real value that defines the maximum SWR1 time-step length to use. 
           RTMAX should be >= RTMIN and <= the minimum MODFLOW time-step length. 
           Adaptive time stepping is disabled if RTMAX = RTMIN. If RTMAX is specified
           to be 0.0 RTMAX is set equal to DELT for the current MODFLOW timestep.
           When RTMAX > 0.0, typical values of RTMAX are between 1 and 24 hours 
           but are dependent on the magnitude of streamflow. Value is in units of
           time and must be consistent with the defined MODFLOW time unit.
RTPRN    - No changes
RTMULT   - No changes
NTMULT   - No changes
DMINGRAD - No changes
DMNDEPTH - No changes
DMAXRAI  - No changes
DMAXSTG  - No changes
DMAXINF  - No changes

Items 3-15: As in previous versions of the code.

o Version 1.03.0 09/09/2013:

  The SWR Process was modified to include the following functionality:
      - UPSTREAM-WEIGHTING OPTION FOR DIFFUSIVE-WAVE FLOW BETWEEN
        CONNECTED REACH GROUPS
      - SWR OBSERVATIONS
      - STAGE DEPENDENT EXTERNAL BOUNDARY STRUCTURE
      - ADDED DIRECT RUNOFF OPTION 
      - GLOBAL AND ABSOLUTE TOLA OPTIONS
      - L2 NORM AND FRACTIONAL TOLR OPTIONS
      - REVISED MODFLOW-SWR QAQ COMPARISON TO KEEP TRACK OF POSITIVE
        AND NEGATIVE TERMS SEPARATELY FOR EACH REACH AND TO DIFFERENCE
        THE DIFFERENCE IN POSITIVE AND THE DIFFERENCE IN NEGATIVE
        TERMS AND DIVIDE BY THE AVERAGE OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
        MODFLOW TERMS.
          value = ( swrpos - mfpos ) - ( swrneg - mfneg ) / mfaverage      
      - ADDED OPTION FOR USING CURRENT STAGE (FROM THE LAST ITERATION) IN  
        A SPECIFIED REACH TO DEFINE THE INITIAL STAGE IN A SPECIFIED REACH. 
        A NEGATIVE REACH NUMBER IS SPECIFIED AND THE RSTAGE VALUE IS THE 
        REACH USED TO DEFINE THE STAGE. ONLY APPLIES TO REACH STAGE DATA 
        SPECIFIED USING LIST INPUT      

  The following minor modifications were made to existing SWR Process 
  functionality:
      - LATERAL FLOW FROM ACTIVE REACH GROUPS TO CONSTANT STAGE REACH 
        GROUPS ARE REPORTED TO THE GLOBAL BUDGET AS EXTERNAL FLOW. THE 
        REMAINDER OF CONSTANT STAGE REACH GROUP FLOW TERMS ARE STILL 
        REPORTED AS CONSTANT FLOW IN THE GLOBAL BUDGET. THIS MODIFICATION 
        WAS MADE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DETERMINE LATERAL FLOW TO OR FROM
        EXTERNAL BOUNDARIES. OTHER SWR OUTPUT HAVE NOT BEEN MODIFIED.
      - SEPARATED QAQ FLOW TO ACTIVE AND CONSTANT HEAD MODFLOW CELLS IN QAQ 
        DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MODFLOW AND SWR SUMMARY WRITTEN TO THE LISTING FILE.

  The SWR Process was modified to correct the following minor bugs:
      - AUX VARIABLES
      - STRUCTURE EXTERNAL TIME SERIES WHEN ONE EXTERNAL TIME SERIES
        IS USED FOR MORE THAN ONE STRUCTURE
      - WRITING COMPACT BUDGET DATA FOR SWR GWET FROM ALL REACHES OTHER
        THAN CELL-BASED REACHES (IGEOTYPE=5)

  Complete SWR input instructions for version 1.03 are provided in
  the included document named 'SWRProcessInputInstructions_v1.03.pdf' in the
  doc subdirectory of this distribution.
